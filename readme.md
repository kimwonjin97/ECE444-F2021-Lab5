## Activity 6:

As the result of styling changes made by activity 2 to activity 5, the new UI has much better readability compared to the previous UI. The borderline around the selection features in the new UI not only makes the item search more convenient but also makes the content(introduction and the result) more clear compared to the old UI. Moreover, the table and the center-aligned text of the result page make the Education Pathway more user-friendly.
